# MILO---A-Virtual-Assisstant-using-Python
I have developed a Simpe  Virtual Assisstant named MILO using python and different python libraries just like an google assisstant it can open youtube and interact with you.

A Virtual Assisstant is an AI powered program that can understand voice/text commands and perform various tasks like answering questions, managing schedules, and automating basic functions. It is built using python with speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP). But I have only use the pytho and speech recognition to make this simple or basic virtual assisstant.

# How it works ? 
1. User gives a voice command  ( ex: " Open facebook " )
2. Speech to text conversion processes the command.
3. The assisstant performs the task ( fetches data, open apps, etc)
4. Text to speech conversion provides a response.

# Conclusion:
A Virtual Assisstant enhances productivity by automating routine tasks. It can be integrated with AI, IOT, or smartphone home devices for more advanced functionalities.
